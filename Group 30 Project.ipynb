    "Being able to predict used car prices can save families thousands of dollars. By using the progam language R, we can plot graphs and get a prediction for how much a car may cost. We can use a method called regression and predict a numerical value for a used car's price based on factors we enter.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will predict the cost of a used car based on mileage and year. As background knowledge, we know that newer products with more technology cost more comapred tp older products with less features. We apply this knowledge to used cars in our prediction. We also know that more used products are valued less than products in better conditions. Knowing that used or worn products are valued less is why we choose mileage as a factor. We believe that overall used car prices will be changed when we change mileage and year.\n",
    "\n",
    "In our example, we use linear regression, as we want interpretability in our final results. In contrast, another option, KNN regression, tends to be more confusing to interpret. With linear regression, we might be able to predict the cost of a used car based on mileage and year. We will be using used, American car prices scraped from the web. We have taken this dataset and put it into our group's repository for easy access. To extract this dataset, we will start with read_csv() of our comma seperated sheet in .csv format, USA_cars_datasets.csv."
