    "Being able to predict used car prices can save families thousands of dollars. By using the progam language R, we can plot graphs and get a prediction for how much a car may cost. We can use a method called regression and predict a numerical value for a used car's price based on factors we enter.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will predict the cost of a used car based on mileage and year. As background knowledge, we know that newer products with more technology cost more comapred tp older products with less features. We apply this knowledge to used cars in our prediction. We also know that more used products are valued less than products in better conditions. Knowing that used or worn products are valued less is why we choose mileage as a factor. We believe that overall used car prices will be changed when we change mileage and year.\n",
    "\n",
    "In our example, we use linear regression, as we want interpretability in our final results. In contrast, another option, KNN regression, tends to be more confusing to interpret. With linear regression, we might be able to predict the cost of a used car based on mileage and year. We will be using used, American car prices scraped from the web. We have taken this dataset and put it into our group's repository for easy access. To extract this dataset, we will start with read_csv() of our comma seperated sheet in .csv format, USA_cars_datasets.csv."

    "To conduct our data analysis, we will look at only mileage, production year of the car, and the brand. The lot number, vin number, state, and the day the listing was uploaded doesn't make a difference. We can visualize our results with many scatterplots. We can use a scatterplot with price on the y axis and year/mileage on the x axis then have a bar plot with price on the x axis and brand on the y axis (like the graph above). We can also get a  measure of accuracy if we use a model called knn regression. As car brands have an effect on the price of cars (as a car from a reputable or luxury car brand will generally be marketed at a higher price than a car with the same specs from a different car brand), we will be separating the data by the car brand and performing regression on every brand individually. This way, we are able to predict car prices accounting for individual brands. We can then visualize these in a line graph and place then together using the patchwork package.\n",
